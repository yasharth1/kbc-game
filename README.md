# kbc-game-py
 A working python version of the game "Who wants to be a millionare?". Features include-
 1. Lifelines (Audience Poll, 50-50, Ask the Expert, Flip the question)
 2. Picture and video questions
 3. Sound effects for everything make it immersive
 4. A cheque after completing the game
 5. Option to quit if you don't know the answer 
 6. Time limit on first 10 questions (beta)

 P.S.- The current code is too long (about 600 lines). Work is in progress to make it much shorter and simple.
